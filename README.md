# rock-paper-scissors
a simple rock paper scissors utility that you can use. Built for windows. Will have to run from source and create own binaries if want on mac/linux

## Installation
take `.exe` binary and add it to your path, call `rps` (short for rock paper scissors) to run the utility. Or rename to whatever you want. Detailed steps:
1. Download package and unzip, rename `.exe` to `rps`.
2. Put the binary (the `.exe`) in a folder it can live permanently.
3. Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables
4. Edit the PATH variable
5. Add the **directory** containing the executable, separating it with semicolons if needed.
6. Restart PC if needed, or refresh terminal. 
7. Type `rps` in terminal. It should run

## Usage
enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. And battle the "Super Intelligent", massively powerful LLM learning agent (I'm being facetious)

## Development
it's basically done. May add a couple small things in the future.
